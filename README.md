#Hunger marketing and Blockchain Technology: Applications in Wireless Spectrum Management
Due to the ever-increasing demand by bandwidth-hungry mobile applications and the prevalent growth in wireless communication, effective spectrum management continues to constitute an important issue. So many spectrum management techniques have been employed in different areas including broadband satellite systems, cognitive acoustic networks, railway cognitive radio networks, and smart grid network environments. Spectrum management mechanisms have evolved to meet the different requirements of increasing spectrum use efficiency.  In this paper, we discuss two state of the art approaches for spectrum management: Hunger marketing and Blockchain technology. We summarize the pros and cons of these technologies and their application in spectrum management.
